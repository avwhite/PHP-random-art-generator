#Random Art Generator

This is a tool for generating random art. It works by generating a mathmatical expression with two variables, x and y, for each color channel. This expression is then evaluated for all coordinates in the picture.

The math expressions are generated randomly from x, y and a bunch of functions whose domain and range is [-1 ; 1]. The functions used is the product, the average of two values, sin and cos. It is important to note that these trigonometric functions dont take the argument in radians nor degrees, but an anglemesurement, where a whole circle is excatly 1, thus ensuring that the functions have the correct domain. (This is simply achived by multiplying the input with 2pi before running the function).
